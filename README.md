# Boda Boda Fare Estimator 

This is a JavaScript program that estimates the total cost of a Boda Boda ride based on the distance in kilometers provided by the user. It's a simple but practical challenge that demonstrates user input handling, arithmetic calculations, conditional logic, and console/alert output.

---

##  Description

The function `calculateBodaFare()` performs the following:

- Prompts the user to input the ride distance in kilometers.
- Validates that the input is a number greater than zero.
- Applies the fare rules:
  - Base fare: KES 50
  - Per kilometer charge: KES 15
- Calculates the total estimated fare.
- Displays the breakdown in both `console.log()` and `alert()`.

Example Input/Output:

```bash
Input: 5
Output:
 For a 5 km Boda Boda ride:
- Base Fare: KES 50
- Distance Fare: KES 75 (KES 15 * 5 km)
=> Total Estimated Fare: KES 125
